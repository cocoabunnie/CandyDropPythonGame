👾The Candy Drop Monster Game👾

This is a drop game that I made using Tkinter and Python while I was in an internship.
The goal of the game is to use your left and right arrow keys to move the
character left and right

✅Catch the colorful candies to gain points!

❌HOWEVER if you catch the red ones, you will lose points.

When your score passes 20 points, you win!

~~~~~~~~ IMPORTANT!! ~~~~~~~~~~~
Please keep in mind that in order for this game to run in the Python IDLE, you also
need the greenChar.gif file in the same folder as the CandyGame.py file
